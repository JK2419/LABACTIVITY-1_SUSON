    <h1>You Know</h1>
    <p>Never thought about a day that I'll be needin' more<br>
    Of this feelin', I can't hide it to you anymore<br>
    The way you look, the way you move, you heatin' up the floor<br>
    Baby, you got that somethin' special knockin' on my door<br>
    (Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-woah, oh)</p>

    <p>Baby, you know (Baby, you know)
    Know I can't control, oh-oh (Know I can't control)<br>
    Can't handle this feelin', babe, stop teasin' me<br> 
    No, I ain't playin' games (Ain't no playin' games)</p>
    

    <p>See, I just wanna let you know that I don't wanna see you go<br>
        Go ahead and leave me hangin', wishin', yearnin' for some more<br>
        I don't wanna lie, gustong mahawakan palagi mga kamay (Yeah)<br>
        Ang makasama ka, 'di ko na mahihintay<br>
        So I should go, I should go to you</p>

    <p>Baby, you know (Baby, you know)<br>
    Know I can't control (Know I can't control)<br>
    Can't handle this feelin', babe, stop teasin' me<br>
    No, I ain't playin' games (Ain't no playin' games)</p>

    <p>Lately, I can't go to sleep<br>
    Thinking 'bout you at night but honestly<br>
    Baby, you my remedy<br>
    For all the pain that's hurtin' me</p>

    <p>Baby, you know (Baby, you know) (Ooh, woah)<br>
    Know I can't control (Know I can't control) (Hey)<br>
    Can't handle this feelin', babe (No, I can't, I can't, I can't)<br>
    Stop teasin' me<br>
    No, I ain't playin' games (Nah, nah, no, nah, nah, no) (Ain't no playin' games)</p>

    <p>Baby, you know (Baby, you know) (Oh-ooh)<br>
    Know I can't control (Know I can't control) (I can't control, ooh-woah)<br>
    Can't handle this feelin' babe<br>
    Stop teasin' me (Yeah, ooh-woah)<br>
    No, I ain't playin' games (Ain't no playin' games)</p>
